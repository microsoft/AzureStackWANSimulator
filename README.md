# Azure Stack WAN Simulator Project
> This repo is still in process but feel free to PR or file issues if any feedback.

## Background

To better support Azure Edge services, by having an automated customized traffic control validation mechanism and deployed to suit rapid growth product request.Â 

This WAN-SIM Solution will help to validate scenarios that matches customer's network (T1,E1,Satellite,etc.) by customize network traffic control variables.

#### Before WAN-SIM Solution
- Lab design is high bandwidth, low latency.
- Edge customers networks are low bandwidth, high latency, and more unstable.

#### After WAN-SIM Solution
- Reroute cluster traffic to WAN-SIM VM, which is a ubuntu VM with FRRouting installed.
- Use NETEM to apply rules on WAN-SIM to control traffic.
- GRE Tunnel between WAN-SIM and TOR Switches.
- Less touch points and easy to integrate with CICD and telemetry.
