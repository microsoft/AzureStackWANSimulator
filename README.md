# Azure Stack WAN Simulator Project
> This repo is still in process but feel free to PR or file issues if any feedback.

## Background

To better support Azure Edge services, by having an automated customized traffic control validation mechanism and deployed to suit rapid growth product request.Â 

This WAN-SIM Solution will help to validate scenarios that matches customer's network (T1,E1,Satellite,etc.) by customize network traffic control variables.

#### Before WAN-SIM Solution
- Lab design is high bandwidth, low latency.
- Edge customers networks are low bandwidth, high latency, and more unstable.

#### After WAN-SIM Solution
- Reroute cluster traffic to WAN-SIM VM, which is a ubuntu VM with FRRouting installed.
- Use NETEM to apply rules on WAN-SIM to control traffic.
- GRE Tunnel between WAN-SIM and TOR Switches.
- Less touch points and easy to integrate with CICD and telemetry.

## Quick Start
Overall, here are main steps:
1. [Setup WAN-SIM VM](./docs/WANSIM_VM_Setup.md)
2. [Update Azure Stack Edge Switch Configuration](./docs/AzureStackEdge_Switch_Config.md)
3. [Define and Validation Network Profile Rule End-to-End](./docs/Network_Profile_Definition_Validation.md)

## Q&A
#### Will this solution break the standard Azure Stack Rack deployment or operation procedure?
The simple anwser is `NO`, the solution is only going to reroute and apply traffic rule on the subnets user defined and that is it.
More detail explainations about the changes:
- The solution will `NOT` change any existing configuration out of box, but only add extra config specific to the WANSIM solution which only impact the standard Azure Stack Service.
- All the outgoing traffic (from Azure Stack rack to Internet) will be redirected to WANSIM VM. 
- However, for incoming traffic (from Internet to Azure Stack rack), only user defined subnets will be redirected to WANSIM VM, all the rest subnets will remain its standard path.
- Because the outgoing and incoming traffic are both passing through WANSIM VM, the traffic control rule can be applied customized profiles for both downloading and uploading.
To summary, the solution will `NOT` break the existing Azure Stack setup, but only customized the traffic path and rules.

#### How to turn down the solution?
This solution is based on FRR service, so to free the rack from this solution, simply execute `sudo service frr stop` on WANSIM VM to shutdown routing service on WANSIM.
