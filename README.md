# Azure Stack WAN Simulator Project
> This repo is current private only, and will open to public once fully reviewed.

## Background

To better support Azure Edge services, by having an automated customized traffic control validation mechanism and deployed to suit rapid growth product request.Â 

This WAN-SIM Solution will help to validate scenarios that matches customer's network (T1,E1,Satellite,etc.) by customize network traffic control variables.

#### Before WAN-SIM Solution
- Lab design is high bandwidth, low latency.
- Edge customers networks are low bandwidth, high latency, and more unstable.

#### After WAN-SIM Solution
- Reroute cluster traffic to WAN-SIM VM, which is a ubuntu VM with FRRouting installed.
- Use NETEM to apply rules on WAN-SIM to control traffic.
- GRE Tunnel between WAN-SIM and TOR Switches.
- Less touch points and easy to integrate with CICD and telemetry.

## Quick Start
Overall, there are four main steps:
- [Setup WAN-SIM VM](./docs/WANSIM_VM_Setup.md)
- [Update Azure Stack Edge Switch Configuration](./docs/AzureStackEdge_Switch_Config.md)
- [Define and Apply Network Profile Rule on WAN-SIM VM](./docs/Network_Profile_Definition.md)
- [Validation Network Profile Rule End-to-End](./docs/Network_Profile_Validation.md)
